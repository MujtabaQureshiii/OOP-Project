# Maze Solver Game

## 1. Project Overview
The **Maze Solver Game** is an engaging 2D puzzle game where players navigate through a randomly generated maze to reach the exit. The game is built using **C++ with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and utilizes **SFML** for a visually appealing and interactive graphical interface. It offers multiple difficulty levels, a start screen, a timer, and various game mechanics to enhance the player’s experience.

## 2. Objectives
- Develop a functional **maze-solving game** with an interactive and user-friendly GUI.
- Implement **C++ OOP concepts** for an efficient and modular backend.
- Provide **different difficulty levels** to accommodate various skill levels.
- Ensure smooth **player movement, collision detection, and win conditions**.
- Utilize **SFML for rendering, event handling, and user interface design**.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Graphics Library:** SFML (for GUI and rendering)
- **Programming Language:** C++ (with OOP principles)
- **Maze Generation Algorithm:** Recursive Backtracking or Prim’s Algorithm
- **Game Logic:** Player movement, collision detection, and win condition

## 4. Features and Functionalities

### Frontend Features (SFML GUI)
#### Start Screen:
- A **main menu** with options: **Start Game, Select Difficulty, and Quit**.

#### User Interface Enhancements:
1. **Graphically enhanced** maze with smooth animations.
2. **Timer system** to track the player’s completion time.
3. **Modern visual elements** with proper scaling and color themes.

### Backend Features (C++ OOP)

#### Maze Generation and Gameplay:
1. **Randomly generated mazes** with different structures in each game session.
2. **Collision detection** to prevent players from passing through walls.
3. **Exit detection** to determine when the player reaches the goal.

#### Difficulty Levels:
1. **Easy Mode:** Small-sized maze with simple paths.
2. **Medium Mode:** Larger maze with moderate complexity.
3. **Hard Mode:** Highly intricate maze with many dead ends and obstacles.

#### Player Mechanics:
1. **Smooth movement using arrow keys/WASD.**
2. **Collision handling** to ensure realistic interactions with walls.
3. **Timer system** to challenge the player based on speed.
