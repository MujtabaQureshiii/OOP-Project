## 1. Executive Summary

### Overview:
The Maze Solver Game is a 2D interactive puzzle game developed using C++ and the SFML library, with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game challenges players to solve procedurally generated mazes within a time limit. The project was designed to explore advanced OOP concepts, graphics programming, and game design fundamentals.

### Key Findings:
- Successful integration of OOP for clean and modular code.
- Procedural maze generation using backtracking algorithm.
- Implementation of difficulty levels and a functional timer system.
- Creation of a visually appealing GUI using SFML.

## 2. Introduction

### Background:
Maze-solving games offer a hands-on way to implement key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This project serves both as an entertaining application and as a learning platform for exploring these concepts in real-world programming.

### Project Objectives:
- Build a fully functional maze-solving game with an intuitive interface.
- Demonstrate effective use of OOP concepts in C++.
- Integrate SFML to handle game rendering and events.
- Provide scalability through multiple difficulty settings.
